To petition for juvenile expungement, you will need to:
1.	Fill out the petition form
2.	Submit your petition to the appropriate court
How much does juvenile expungement cost?
The cost is different in each parish.  In New Orleans, it costs $450 to expunge a single case or arrest. However, many people qualify for a fee waiver that will waive $200, which would reduce the cost to $250.  You can talk with a lawyer about whether there is any way to reduce that fee.

After I petition for juvenile expungement, what are the chances that my petition will be approved?
Whether your petition is approved is up to the judge. However, in the past, most petitions have been approved.
