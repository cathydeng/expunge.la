  <h3>If you were arrested in Louisiana when you were 17 or younger, you probably have a juvenile record</h3>
</div> 

    <p>Your juvenile record can have long-lasting negative effects on your life. The good news: most juvenile records can be erased through a process called <b>juvenile expungement!</b> Expungement essentially wipes the slate clean - all files and information are destroyed, as if your arrest never happened!</p><br>
