	<h3>You are not yet eligible to apply for juvenile expungement, but hold tight!  You will be eligible as soon as you no longer have any open cases and are not on probation or parole.</h3>

	<p class="small-text">Note: An “open” case is any case where you are on probation or parole, or have not yet gone to trial or pled guilty.  A case is “closed” if the judge found you  not guilty or you successfully completed your sentence.</p>
